🚀 About Me

I am an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist with a background in Software Engineering, hands-on experience in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics, and a degree in Social Psychology.

Due to immigration-related circumstances, I was unable to complete my original Software Engineering studies. I later completed a vocational training (Ausbildung) as a hairdresser and worked professionally for two years. This experience strengthened my discipline, reliability, and responsibility.
I have since deliberately returned to tech through intensive self-study and certified training, focusing on practical, real-world AI applications.
